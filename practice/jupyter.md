# Jupyter Notebooks Basics and Python Exercises

## Introduction
In this assignment, you will learn the basics of Jupyter Notebooks and practice your Python programming skills with a set of beginner-level exercises. Jupyter Notebooks are a popular tool for interactive computing and data analysis. They allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text.

To complete this assignment, you will need to install Jupyter Notebooks on your computer. The installation instructions provided below will guide you through the process on Windows, Mac, and other operating systems. Additionally, you will fork a repository on Git and submit your assignment by making a pull request.

## Installation Instructions
Follow the instructions below to install Jupyter Notebooks on your operating system:

### Windows
<details>
  <summary>Installation in Windows</summary>
1. Install pip by downloading the [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) file and running it with Python.
2. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebook site, and install Jupyter using pip:
``` 
pip install notebook
```
3. Run the following command in the command prompt to start a new Jupyter session:
```
jupyter notebook
```

**Make sure not to install JupyterLab**, what you need is Jupyter Notebook. If you have installed JupyterLab, you can uninstall it by running the following command:
```
# Uninstall jupyterlab in case you downloaded it
pip uninstall jupyterlab
```

## The Assignment

Visit the assignment repository on Git https://github.com/FacultadDeIngenieria/tallerprog1jupyter

There's a pre-existing jupyter notebook file, you need to make a copy of it before starting.

The copy must be named `firstname_lastname.ipynb` with firstname being your actual firstname and lastname your actual firstname. If you are named Juan Perez, the file should be named `juan_perez.ipynb`.

The assignment needs to be performed in that copy file, there's an export needed to be performed during the assignment, but other than the copy jupyter notebook and a html file, **no additional files should be created or added**.

All the instructions and exercises are in the notebook file, you can open it with Jupyter Notebook and start working on it.

Here's a checklist in case you aren't sure what to do:

- [ ] Install Jupyter Notebooks
- [ ] Create a copy of the notebook file and rename it.
- [ ] Open the notebook file with Jupyter Notebooks
- [ ] Complete the exercises in the notebook file
    - [ ] Make sure to save your changes
    - [ ] Make sure to run your code to check for errors
    - [ ] Make sure that every exercise is finished
