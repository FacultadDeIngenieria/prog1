**Instructions**: For this assignment, you will work with Python's re module to practice using regular expressions. Each exercise will require you to write a Python script that uses regular expressions to solve a specific task.


You will need to familiarize yourself with the functions of the library: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

## Exercises:

### Exercise 1: 
Write a Python program that matches and prints all words that start with the letter 'A' in a given text.

### Exercise 2: 
Create a Python program to validate email addresses. The program should check if a given string is a valid email address or not.

### Exercise 3: 
Write a Python program to find and count all the digits in a given text.

### Exercise 4: 
Create a Python program that extracts all the URLs (http:// or https://) from a given text.

### Exercise 5: 
Write a Python program that extracts all the phone numbers (in the format xxx-xxx-xxxx) from a given text.

### Exercise 6: 
Write a Python program that replaces all occurrences of "Python" with "Java" in a given text.

### Exercise 7: 
Create a Python program to validate US ZIP codes (5 digits, optional hyphen, followed by 4 more digits).

### Exercise 8: 
Write a Python program that extracts all the words with 3 or more consecutive vowels from a given text.

### Exercise 9: 
Write a Python program that extracts all the words that are enclosed in double quotes in a given text.

### Exercise 10: 
Create a Python program that extracts all the dates in the format "dd/mm/yyyy" from a given text.

### Exercise 11: 
Write a Python program that extracts all the words that contain only lowercase letters from a given text.

### Exercise 12: 
Create a Python program that finds and prints all the hashtags (words starting with #) in a given text.

### Exercise 13: 
Create a Python program to validate and extract ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 numbers from a given text.

### Exercise 14: 
Write a Python program that extracts all the words that are exactly 5 characters long from a given text.

### Exercise 15: 
Create a Python program to validate and extract IPv4 addresses from a given text.

### Exercise 16: 
Write a Python program that extracts all the words that end with "ing" from a given text.

### Exercise 17: 
Create a Python program to validate and extract MAC addresses (in the format XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX) from a given text.

# Submission:

Create a single Python file containing all your solutions.
Add comments to your code to explain each exercise.
Use the following text to validate your regex:

Once upon a time, in the enchanted land of Regexville, there lived a group of intrepid explorers.

Their leader, Alice, was known for her love of adventure and her trusty email address, alice@example.com.

Her phone number, 123-456-7890, was her lifeline in times of trouble.

One day, Alice received a mysterious letter with today's date: 08/10/2023. The letter hinted at an upcoming quest.



The explorers gathered at the local inn, where they found a weathered map marked with a hashtag: #adventure.

The map pointed to a hidden treasure on the website https://www.treasurehunt.com. The inn's address was 123 Main Street, Regexville, ZIP: 12345-6789.



Their journey took them through the ancient forest, where they stumbled upon a cave with cryptic inscriptions:

"Python is amazing!" and "Java is equally fascinating!" The explorers knew they were on the right path.

Inside the cave, they found a device with the IP address 192.168.1.1, which held valuable clues.



Among the explorers, there was a wordsmith who loved finding words with three consecutive vowels:

"boasting," "quizzical," "genuine," and "queue" were some of his favorites.



As they continued their adventure, they encountered Lorem Ipsum, a lorem ipsum generator who spoke in Latin:

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."



In their pursuit, they stumbled upon an ancient book with mysterious ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 numbers:

ISBN-10: 123456789X and ISBN-13: 978-1234567890.



Their journey was filled with unexpected twists and turns, much like the regex patterns they used to decipher clues.



After a long day, the explorers gathered around a campfire, sharing tales of their encounters. They realized that every step of their adventure was a puzzle waiting to be solved, just like the regex challenges they had conquered.



As they drifted off to sleep under a starlit sky, they knew that their quest for treasure and knowledge had only just begun, and the magic of Regexville would continue to guide their way.
