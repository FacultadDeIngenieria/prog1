# REPL

.center[![REPL]({{site.baseurl}}/presentation/run-python/repl.png))]

- **R**ead-**E**valuate-**P**rint-**L**oop
- Interactive Python
- Run Python code directly
- Useful for testing code, functions, libraries

---

# REPL 

Code can be single or multi lined

---

# Scripts

- Python code saved in a file
- Can be run from the command line: `python script.py`
- Can be executed by an IDE, REPL or Notebook

# Notebook

# What can I do in Notebooks?

- Interactive Python
- Run Python code directly
- Useful for testing code, functions, libraries
- Can be saved as a file

---

# Jupyter Notebook

Installing Jupyter: https://jupyter.org/install#jupyter-notebook
 
- Jupyter is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.
- Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
- Stores code, results and comments in a file with extension `.ipynb`

---

# Cells

.center[![Jupyter Menu]({{site.baseurl}}/presentation/run-python/jupyter-menu.png)]

- Cells can be of type Code or Markdown
- **Markdown** is a markup language that is a superset of HTML. It is used to write comments and documentation.
- Cells can be executed by pressing `Shift + Enter`
- Green outline means cell is in edit mode
- Blue outline means cell is in command mode


--- 

# Kernel

Behind every notebook runs a kernel. When you run a code cell, that code is executed within the kernel. Any output is returned back to the cell to be displayed. The kernel’s state persists over time and between cells — it pertains to the document as a whole and not individual cells.

# Sharing Notebooks

- Notebooks can be shared by exporting them as HTML, PDF, Markdown, etc.
- Notebooks can be shared by uploading them to a repository (GitHub, GitLab, Google Collab, etc.)
