## Shells and Terminals

A shell is a command interpreter. It takes commands from the user, and delivers them to the operating system to perform.

A terminal is a program that lets you interact with the shell.

- Available on any OS
- Flexible & Efficient
- Great for prototyping and automating simple tasks

## Bash (1989)

Bourne Again Shell

Bash is an enhanced version of the Bourne Shell, or sh (1977)

Default shell on most UNIX operating systems

---
## Bash interactive and non-interactive mode

Interactive: allows running commands through a prompt, one command at a time.

Non-interactive: run bash commands through scripts, automating certain logic. A script is a list of commands (same as the ones that can be typed in a command line), stored in a file. It executes commands sequentially.

---
## Interactive mode: Commands

BASH reads commands from its input (either a terminal or a file)

Each "line" is treated as a command: an instruction to be carried out

Bash divides each line into words separated by a whitespace character (space or tab)

The first word of the line is the name of the command to be executed, all other words are arguments.

`$ man man`

`$` Usually indicates that the shell is Bash compatible

`man` "manual", displays manual documentation pages

Each command on your system is likely to have a man page

In a UNIX OS, to leave the manual page use q and press enter

## Navigating directories

mkdir - Creates a directory
- `mkdir facultad` creates a directory called `facultad`
- `mkdir facultad/programacion1` creates a directory called `programacion` inside `facultad/programacion1`

cd - Change directory
- `cd facultad/programacion1` changes the current directory to `facultad`

touch - Create a file
- `touch resumen_de_la_mejor_materia.txt` creates a file called `resumen_de_la_mejor_materia.txt`

ls - List directory's contents
- `ls` lists the files in the working directory

---
## Piping

'|' allows connecting UNIX programs to each other.

`ls | grep hi`

ls lists the files in the working directory, this output is checked by the grep command for the word `hi`

---
## Manipulating Files

cat - Read file and write it to the standard output
- `cat resumen_de_la_mejor_materia.txt` prints the contents of the file `resumen_de_la_mejor_materia.txt`

cp - Copy File(s)
- `cp resumen_de_la_mejor_materia.txt resumen_de_la_mejor_materia_2.txt` copies the file `resumen_de_la_mejor_materia.txt` to `resumen_de_la_mejor_materia_2.txt`

mv - Move File(s)
- `mv resumen_de_la_mejor_materia_2.txt facultad/programacion1.txt` moves the file `resumen_de_la_mejor_materia_2.txt` to `facultad/programacion1.txt

rm - Remove File(s) and directories
- `rm facultad/programacion1.txt` removes the file `facultad/programacion1.txt`

echo - Writes arguments to the standard output
- `echo rm *.txt` prints all the options to be removed to make sure we are deleteing what we want to delete.
