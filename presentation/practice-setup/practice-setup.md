TPs are mandatory in order to have the subject approved. You are required to approved 2 Parciales and all the TPs. Your subject final note, will be the average between all your
evaluations (incluiding your make-up exams if applied).

Your final TP note will be the sum of all TPs handed in, in time and with the tests running and passing. If any of this criteria doesn't applied, then 1 point out of the sum of TPs will 
be taken off. You need to hand-in at least 60% of all tps in order to pass the subject. 60% is a 4 in number. If you don't make 60% of the TPs, then you will not pass the subject, even though you had the 
2 Parciales approved.
